Architectural Design for a Cache Controller Interfacing a 16-Bit M-Processor

* Designed a cache controller with cache size of 256 KB in size and implemented an interface for the same with 16MB DRAM

* Achieved performance in Cholesky functions which operate on a 256 by 256 symmetric matrix of double-precision real floating numbers by 24%

* Implemented Cholesky functions in MATLAB, design of the cache controller in C
